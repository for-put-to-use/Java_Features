	 * A functional interface is an interface that contains

	 * Single Abstract Method Interfaces (SAM)
	 * 
	 * only one abstract method but any number of default or static methods

	 * builtin Functional Interfaces:
	 * 		1. Runnable -> run()
	 * 		2. Comparable -> compareTo()
	 * 		3. ActionListener -> actionPerformed()
	 * 		4. Callable -> call()
	 * Functional Interfaces
	 * 		F,P,S->C
	 * 		1. Function - takes input, does something and returns something
	 * 			BiFunction
	 * 		2. Predicate - takes input, does something and returns true or false
	 * 		3. Consumer - takes input, does something and won't return anything
	 * 			IntConsumer
	 * 		4. Supplier - doesn't take any input, only returns something
